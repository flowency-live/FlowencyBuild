# Pricing

Fast, transparent, SME-friendly.

Amplified Tech works on one simple principle:  
**You only pay for value. Not for endless planning, meetings, or time-wasting.**

We keep pricing clear, fixed, and fair  - so you know exactly what you're getting.

---

## 1. Free Discovery + Working Prototype
We spend a day with you  - online or in person  - to understand your business, your bottlenecks, and your biggest opportunities.

**At the end of discovery, you get:**
- A working prototype or proof-of-concept  
- An outline of the value unlocked  
- Clear, measurable ROI  
- Options to continue (no pressure, no sales pitch)

**Price:** **FREE**  
(This is our moat. No one else gives you working software upfront.)

---

## 2. MVP Build (Fixed Price)
Once discovery is done, we agree the scope together and deliver a fully working Minimum Viable Product within a week.

**Includes:**
- Custom mini-ERP modules  
- Dashboards + insights  
- Internal automations  
- Custom workflows  
- AI-powered features  
- Hosting setup  
- Deployment + handover  
- One round of refinement

**Price:**  
- **£2,500** simple MVP (single workflow or micro-product)  
- **£5,000** standard MVP (multi-workflow, dashboards, user accounts)  
- **£9,000** advanced MVP (complex logic, multi-system integration, AI agents)

All fixed. No hidden extras.
