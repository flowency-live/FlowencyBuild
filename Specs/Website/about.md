# About Amplified Tech

Amplified Tech exists to solve a simple problem:

**Most SMEs are running multi-million-pound operations on spreadsheets, manual processes, and guesswork  - and they don’t have the time, capability, or confidence to modernise.**

We fix that, fast.

We build practical AI-powered tools, dashboards, automations, and mini-ERPs that give small businesses the clarity and digital capability usually reserved for large organisations  - without the cost, complexity, or consultant nonsense.

---

## Our Mission
To give SMEs the digital capability they never had  - and the clarity they’ve always needed  - so they can grow with confidence in the AI era.

---

## Our Difference

### **We build real things, not documents**
We don't produce PowerPoints or recommendations.  
We build working systems  - fast.

### **We start with value, not tech**
Everything we build must:
- Save time  
- Increase margin  
- Reduce errors  
- Provide clarity  
- Automate the painful bits  

No value = no build.

### **We amplify *your* way of working**
We don’t impose frameworks or force you into someone else’s process.  
We upgrade the way you already operate.

### **Working prototypes on day one**
Our discovery process produces a working prototype  - in the room  - before you ever pay a penny.

### **Fast, fixed-price MVPs**
Your MVP is delivered in under a week, with clear scope and no surprises.

### **Credit-based enhancements**
You evolve at your pace with flexible credit packs. No retainers. No waste.

## Who We Work With
Amplified Tech is built for:

- SMEs stuck in spreadsheets  
- Founders with ideas but no tech team  
- Operations teams drowning in admin  
- Scale-ups needing clarity before investment  
- Businesses frustrated with agencies, dev shops, or big consultancies  
- Anyone who knows AI can help them  - but doesn’t know where to start  

If you run a business but don’t have time to build the tools you need…  
We build them for you.

## Our Values

### **1. Practicality over perfection**  
If it doesn’t help today, it’s not useful.

### **2. Radical clarity**  
We help you see your business clearly  - with dashboards, data, insight, and transparency.

### **3. No fluff. No jargon. No nonsense.**  
SMEs need clarity, not buzzwords.

### **4. Evidence, not opinions**  
We measure what matters. We show you the numbers. We improve what counts.

### **5. Build fast, evolve continuously**  
Small businesses move quickly  - your systems should too.
