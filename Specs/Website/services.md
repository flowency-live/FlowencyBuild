# Services  - Amplified Tech

We build fast, practical digital capability for SMEs.  
Everything is delivered through our three core service pillars:

# Build · Automate · Amplify

---

# 1. BUILD  
### Websites, Apps & Internal Tools  - Built Around *Your* Business

Most SMEs don’t need “enterprise software” or £50k systems.  
You need simple, reliable tools that match how your business actually works.

We build exactly that  - fast.

### What we build

#### Websites  
- Ultra-fast marketing sites  
- Conversion-focused landing pages  
- Simple multi-page sites for services  
- Booking, enquiry or quote forms  
- Lightweight content management  
- AI-enhanced copy + lead handling  

#### Custom Internal Tools  
- Lightweight CRM tools  
- Mini-ERP systems  
- Job and workflow trackers  
- Customer or supplier portals  
- Internal dashboards  
- Team tools for allocation, scheduling and handovers  

#### Apps  
- Simple mobile-first tools and web apps  
- Customer self-service apps  
- Operations apps for field teams  
- AI assistants embedded into your processes  

### Why this matters  
Most SMEs run on spreadsheets, emails and manual processes.  
A simple internal system can transform margin, speed and customer satisfaction.

**We can usually deliver a working first version in under a week.**

# 2. AUTOMATE  
### Remove Admin. Remove Friction. Remove Waste.

If your business is growing, admin becomes your biggest bottleneck.  
We automate the repetitive work that slows you down.

### What we automate

#### Workflow Automation  
- Job intake and allocation  
- Customer onboarding steps  
- Approvals, notifications and reminders  
- Quote → invoice → payment workflows  
- Task handovers between team members  

#### Data Automation  
- Moving data between tools (email → CRM, form → spreadsheet → system)  
- Cleaning, merging and validating information  
- Auto-populating documents  
- Removing duplicate manual entry  

#### Document & Communication Automation  
- Auto-generated quotes, invoices, contracts  
- Automated customer updates  
- Daily or weekly internal summaries  
- Report generation  

#### AI Assistants  
- FAQ and query-handling bots  
- Internal lookup assistants (jobs, customers, stock)  
- Drafting emails, reports and customer messages  
- Intelligent form completion  

### Why this matters  
Automation pays for itself quickly.  
It reduces mistakes, accelerates turnaround and removes countless hours of admin.

# 3. AMPLIFY  
### Understand Your Business. Improve Your Business.

Once your data starts flowing through clean tools and automated workflows,  
we amplify your business through clarity and insight.

### What we provide

#### Dashboards  
- Profit & loss snapshots  
- Margin per job or per customer  
- Pipeline, workload and throughput  
- Performance and bottleneck tracking
