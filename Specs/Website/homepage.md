## The problem (why you’re here)

Most SMEs are being held back by their own tools.

- You’re running core operations on spreadsheets and email threads.  
- Important information lives in people’s heads, shared drives, or old systems.  
- Admin work eats time you should be spending on customers and growth.  
- You want to use AI and automation, but don’t know where to start.  
- Agencies want big budgets, long timelines and vague “transformation” projects.  

Meanwhile, your competitors are getting faster, clearer and more automated.

You don’t need a six-month project.  
You need **the right tools, built fast, around the way you already work.**

## What we do

We build, automate and amplify the way your business runs.

### Build · Automate · Amplify

#### Build
Websites, apps and internal tools that actually match how your business works.

- Lightweight CRMs and mini-ERPs  
- Job and workflow trackers  
- Customer portals  
- Booking / scheduling tools  
- Operational dashboards  
- Internal web apps and simple mobile tools  

If you’ve ever said “we just need a simple system for X”, that’s what we build.

---

#### Automate
We remove repetitive work and glue your existing tools together.

- Automating manual admin and data entry  
- Joining up forms, inboxes, spreadsheets and systems  
- Generating docs, emails and reports automatically  
- Simple AI assistants for common questions and lookups  
- Notifications, reminders and follow-ups that never get forgotten  

The goal: less copy-paste, fewer mistakes, more time for real work.

---

#### Amplify
Once the basics are in place, we help you see and improve the whole picture.

- Clear visibility on jobs, status and throughput  
- Simple views of margin, costs and profitability  
- Bottleneck and delay hotspots  
- Where work is getting stuck and why  
- Where automation or small tools would have the biggest impact  

We don’t tell you how to run your business.  
We **amplify your way of working** and make it easier to manage, grow and sell.

## How it works

We keep this as simple and low-risk as possible.

### 1. Free discovery session with a working prototype

We spend time with you (in person or remote) to:

- Understand how the business actually runs  
- Find the biggest sources of waste, admin and frustration  
- Identify where a small tool, system or automation could unlock big value  

During or shortly after that session, we build **a small working prototype** to prove what’s possible.

You don’t pay for this.  
If it’s not useful, you walk away.

---

### 2. Build in a week

If you want to move ahead, we agree:

- What we’re going to build  
- What “good” looks like for you  
- A fixed price for a first version (MVP)  

Then we build it  - typically within a week.

No long project plans.  
No endless workshops.  
Just a working system you can start using.

---

### 3. Improve and extend with credits

Once the first version is live, you can:

- Buy a block of **credits** and “call off” improvements when you’re ready  
- Add new features, integrations or automations  
- Tidy up rough edges as your team starts using the tool  
- Add dashboards and reporting once data starts flowing  

You stay in control of spend.  
We stay focused on changes that clearly improve your business.

---

## What you get out of this

We don’t sell “digital transformation”.  
We deliver practical improvements you can feel in day-to-day operations.

Typical outcomes:

- Less time wasted on manual admin  
- Fewer spreadsheets and copy-paste routines  
- Fewer dropped balls and “who’s doing what?” moments  
- Faster quotation, booking and job turnaround  
- Clearer view of margin and profitability  
- Better service for your customers  
- A more valuable, more sellable business  

If we can’t see how to measure the value, we’ll say so  - and we won’t try to sell you anything.
