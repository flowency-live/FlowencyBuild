                <p>
                  The way SMEs build digital capability is broken. And I got tired of watching it happen.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I've spent 30 years building products, fixing operations and delivering real systems across aviation, finance, healthcare and digital operations. I've seen what works. I've seen what fails. And the pattern is always the same.
                </p>

                    Most transformation failures are not technical. They are human.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                  I've watched businesses spend six months debating a deck instead of fixing the problem. I've watched consultancies sell frameworks that gather dust. I've watched agencies deliver beautiful websites that do nothing to help people do their jobs. I've watched dev teams over-engineer systems nobody asked for.
                </p>

                {/* GOLD STACK: Spreadsheets and heroics */}
                <p>
                  And meanwhile, SMEs are running multi-million pound operations on <strong>spreadsheets, inboxes and heroic memory.</strong>
                </p>

                <p className="text-foreground/60">
                  Not because they lack ambition. Because they lack access.
                </p>

                <p>
                  No internal tech team. No CTO. No one who can diagnose the real problem and actually deliver a fix. No time to step back and see clearly. No partner who tells them the truth. No access to the kind of capability that bigger firms take for granted.
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold text-xl">
                  That gap is why this company exists.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I built something different because SMEs deserve better. They move fast. They make decisions. They don't hide behind committees. They just need someone who can match that pace and build what they actually need.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My approach is simple: get in the room, understand the real problem, and build a working solution before anyone has time to write a specification document.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Working prototypes on day one. MVPs in a week. Systems tailored to your operation. No jargon. No theatre. No wasted effort.
